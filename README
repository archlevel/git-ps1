git-ps1 - git-augmented PS1 for BASH

To use, modify your PS1 variable (e.g. in ~/.bashrc) to include the script:
  PS1="$PS1\$($( cat git-ps1.sh ))"

This script produces output in a number of different colors. To ensure the
prompt operates correctly, non-printable characters must be escaped (\[\]).
However, these characters are not recognized when output from an external
script. Therefore, the script must be inserted directly into the PS1 string,
where echoing the escape sequence will produce the intended result.
